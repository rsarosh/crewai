# Monthly Report

## Section 1: Status of Tasks/Projects (Completed, Current or On Going)

### Completed:
- **Proof of Concept (POC) for Document Processing Using AWS**
  - The POC aimed at evaluating the capabilities of AWS in handling document processing requirements was successfully completed. It involved testing various AWS services, such as Textract and Comprehend, to automate the data extraction and processing tasks. The findings demonstrated AWS's robust ability to process a variety of document formats with high accuracy and efficiency.

- **Creation of Presentation on Real-time Cost Tracking of Azure AI Metrics API for LLMs**
  - A detailed presentation was developed to provide insights into the cost associated with using Azure AI Metrics API for large language model operations. The presentation outlined methodologies for real-time tracking and forecasting of these costs, proving to be a valuable resource for stakeholders aiming to optimize their AI model expenditures.

- **Two-part Series on Langchain**
  - Part One and Part Two of a comprehensive series on Langchain were completed. These publications explored the foundational elements of Langchain, illustrating fundamental concepts and providing a hands-on guide to integrating Human-in-the-Loop systems and LangSmith functionalities. The series has been well-received, particularly for its practical approach and in-depth analysis.

### Current:
- **Fine-tuning Document Processing with the NeMo Framework**
  - Currently underway is the fine-tuning of document processing functionalities utilizing the NeMo framework. The initiative is leveraging NVIDIAâ€™s NIM platform for deployment. The adjustment aims to enhance processing efficiency and accuracy, particularly in specialized document recognition.

- **Ongoing Test for Azure OpenAI 4.0 Chatbot**
  - Active testing is being conducted on a newly developed chatbot that employs Azure OpenAI 4.0 technology. The integration of grounded content is showing promising results, with preliminary tests indicating a significant improvement in user engagement and response accuracy.

## Section 2: Problem Areas & Corrective Actions

- **Integration Challenges with NeMo Framework**
  - Challenges have been identified in seamlessly integrating the NeMo framework with existing systems. A task force has been constituted to address these compatibility issues, focusing on refining the deployment scripts and enhancing the support libraries.

- **Cost Management of Azure API**
  - While presenting a reliable cost-tracking methodology, managing dynamic LLM costs remains a concern. Efforts are being undertaken to develop more predictive analytics tools using historical data, which should assist in better financial planning.

- **Chatbot Performance Consistency**
  - Initial tests of the Azure OpenAI 4.0 chatbot indicated sporadic inconsistencies in performance. Performance tuning tasks are focused on optimizing grounded content algorithms to ensure consistent system responses across varying input scenarios.

## Section 3: Accomplishments for the Month

- **Dual Chatbot Creation in Azure for Performance Analysis**
  - Successfully created and tested two distinct chatbots built on Azure, differing in the foundational architecture (HTML files vs text files). The comparative study has made significant contributions to identifying the strengths and runs of different data structures in chatbot workflows, leading to enhanced future implementations.

- **Completion of AWS Document Processing POC**
  - The comprehensive POC work successfully validated AWS's capabilities, setting a benchmark for future document processing ventures and providing a wealth of knowledge on AWS's document handling strengths and weaknesses.

This report outlines the significant progress made over the past month, highlights challenges with targeted corrective actions, and documents notable successes across a myriad of technological implementations. The proactive stance on troubleshooting and optimization reflects a commitment to maintaining high standards of efficiency and innovation.
