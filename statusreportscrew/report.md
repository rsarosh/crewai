## Section 1: Status of Tasks/Projects (Completed, Current or On-Going)

### 1. POC Completion for Document Processing
The Proof of Concept (POC) for document processing using AWS has reached completion. This milestone signifies a successful initial feasibility and capability assessment. The results affirm that the solution's design is sound and capable of achieving its intended purpose. To build upon these findings, the next phases will involve conducting comprehensive performance evaluation and scalability testing. Such efforts aim to ensure that the document processing solution can efficiently manage larger datasets or increased transaction volumes without compromising on performance.

### 2. Fine-Tuning with NeMo Framework
Current development efforts are concentrated on refining the document processing capabilities through the NeMo framework, a state-of-the-art tool deployed via NVIDIA NIM. The ongoing phase represents a crucial step towards optimizing processing speed and accuracy. As the project progresses, it is valuable to execute scheduled benchmarks comparing the performance of the enhanced solution against initial baseline results. These benchmarks are instrumental in quantifying the improvements achieved and informing further developmental iterations.

### 3. Presentation on Azure AI Metrics API
Completion of the presentation on Azure AI Metrics API showcases our ability to track real-time expenses related to large language models (LLM) more effectively. This project has equipped stakeholders with insightful tools to manage and optimize costs associated with LLM deployment. Moving forward, the team recommends maintaining regular updates to cost models to reflect the dynamic nature of the field and exploring further optimization strategies for cost reduction.

### 4. Educational Content on Langchain
We have successfully developed a comprehensive two-part educational series on Langchain. This series delves into the basics of Human in the Loop concepts and LangSmith functionalities, effectively contributing to educational outreach and knowledge dissemination. For continued impact and engagement, plans are in place to expand this educational initiative to include interactive workshops or sessions aimed at deepening practical understandings and applications of the concepts taught.

### 5. Chatbot Development and Comparison on Azure
The chatbot development initiative has reached a significant phase with the creation and comparison of two chatbots on Azure, utilizing distinct data formats—HTML and text files. This comparative analysis aims to identify optimal data formats or methodologies that enhance chatbot functionality. The investigative scope will extend to testing various data structures and chatbot algorithms to yield more comprehensive insights and guide future innovation.

### 6. Testing New Chatbot on Azure OpenAI 4.0
Ongoing tests with a new chatbot, leveraging grounded content on Azure OpenAI 4.0, demonstrate marked improvement in performance. To ensure the robustness and reliability of this solution when applied on a broader scale, testing will continue with diverse and complex use cases. Integrating regular feedback and updates into this testing phase will be prudent to further optimize the chatbot's utility and value in varied applied scenarios.

## Section 2: Problem Areas & Corrective Actions

### 1. Challenges in Scalability Testing
While the POC for document processing showed promising results, the scalability testing presented unexpected challenges, particularly in handling transaction volumes significantly larger than average. To tackle this, the team has proposed the adoption of a modular scaling approach that allows for incremental scaling tests to pinpoint performance bottlenecks early.

### 2. Accuracy Discrepancies in NeMo Framework Benchmarking
Initial refinement steps using the NeMo framework indicated some discrepancies in accuracy improvements. Investigators found that model tuning parameters needed more precise calibration. To correct this, a task force focusing on parameter fine-tuning will be established, using intensive iterative testing to stabilize accuracy levels.

### 3. Cost Model Dynamic Updation
Post-presentation on Azure AI Metrics API, discrepancies in predicted versus actual costs emerged due to underestimated model dynamics. Corrective measures include frequent recalibrations of cost models with the latest operational data and introducing predictive analytics to preempt cost anomalies.

### 4. Lag in Educational Content Engagement
Despite developing comprehensive Langchain educational content, user engagement and feedback did not meet expected thresholds. As a corrective response, we will deploy streamlined feedback collection methods and incorporate interactive elements earlier in the content to boost participation.

### 5. Data Format Efficiency Variability
During chatbot comparison stages, unexpected variability in data format efficiency was observed. To mitigate this, an expanded data format study is proposed, capitalizing on A/B testing methodologies to gather granular insights into performance variabilities.

### 6. Variable Performance in Azure OpenAI 4.0 Tests
Tests on the new chatbot revealed inconsistent performance across different contextual interactions. The corrective action will involve conducting a broader spectrum of use case simulations and implementing machine learning feedback loops to enhance adaptability and consistency.
