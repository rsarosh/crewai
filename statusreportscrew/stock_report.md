**American International Group, Inc. (AIG) - Recommendation: Hold**

### Analysis:

1. **Valuation Metrics:**
   - **Trailing PE:** 18.27 (below the threshold of 25) - Indicates reasonable valuation compared to peers.
   - **Forward PE:** 10.62 (below the threshold of 15) - Suggests expected earnings growth making it potentially undervalued.

7. **News and External Factors:**

### News Highlights:

- Truist Financial Corp holds a significant stake.
- Morgan Stanley's price target adjustment and positive expectations by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
- Reduction in holdings by Stratos Wealth Partners LTD.
- AIG's substantial profit report for Q4 2024.

### Conclusion:
AIG shows potential value given its current pricing and forward PE, suggesting it might be undervalued. However, the high debt levels and negative profit margin are concerning and partially offset the optimism derived from growth metrics and analyst expectations. Current analyst consensus leans towards holding with upside potential and no major negative insider sentiment. In light of these factors, a "Hold" recommendation is appropriate for existing investors to wait for clearer signals on profitability improvements and debt reduction before reconsidering positions or adding more shares.
